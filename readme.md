## Incorporation of JavaScript üìù

‚Üê `Selecting Outfits`: When users click on images of clothes like tops, bottoms, and accessories, JavaScript helps change the outfit on the virtual model. It knows what type of clothing was clicked based on the image.

‚Üê `Instant Changes`: As soon as a user picks an item, the JavaScript code updates the model's outfit right away. This means users can see how their choices look together immediately, making it easy to mix and match.

‚Üê `Reset Option`: There‚Äôs a button that lets users start over. This button uses JavaScript to clear the current selections and reset the model‚Äôs outfit, so users can create a new look without refreshing the page.

‚Üê `Working with HTML` : JavaScript connects with the buttons and images on the page.
